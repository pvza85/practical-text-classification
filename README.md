# Practical Text Classification
Practical comparison algorithms and packages for multi class text classification. I would try to cover several benchmark datasets along real datasets that we use in [5CA Alliance](https://www.5ca.com/) for automizing customer support. Also, I will try to report wide range of algorithms and packages that are common in NLP from simplest TF/IDF with Logistic regression to newest Language Models including [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and [XLNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237).
The problem with most comparisons that I could reach was that they were all focused on the quality of classification and I couldn't find any investigation over model size, training time, prediction time and other factors. In some cases it is not practical to implement successful algorithms and in some cases more humble, easier algorithms are fine enough. I will compare all algorithms over Recall, Precision, F-Score, Training Time, Predicting Time, Model Size and more.

I will use other previous works including very nice work of [Kamran Kowsari et. al.](https://github.com/kk7nc/Text_Classification).
